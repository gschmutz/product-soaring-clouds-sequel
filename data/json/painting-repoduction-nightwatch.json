    "name" : "Rembrandt's The Nightwatch - Oil Painting Reproduction on Canvas",
    "description" : "Ever-vigilant and on their guard, Rembrandt's majestic group portrait captures the patience, the inscrutable humility, and the everyday heroism of a neighbourhood militia. Keeping watch over their locality and, in a wider-sense, over the nation itself, the Dutch master's canvas depicts what would not have been an unusual sight in the towns and cities of Holland during heir attempt to win independence from the Spanish. Commissioned at the height of the Dutch Golden Age of painting, Rembrandt delivered the painting in 1642 to the members of the civic militia guard pictured within the frame, and was paid an astronomical sum for his troubles. The Night Watch was originally named, rather drily, The Company of captain Frans Banning Cocq and lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch preparing to march out, perhaps not fully grasping the enduring legacy that this triumphant work would hold in the national zeitgeist.  Oil painting on canvas, 100% hand-painted by our master artists;Painting comes with a Certificate of Authenticity",
