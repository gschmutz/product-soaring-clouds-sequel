Sophisticated style and bold colour combine to create the perfect tulip for mass plantings or as a chic complement to darker hued varieties. Making its debut in mid spring, it wows with vibrant colour and a pleasing, egg-shaped form. Snowy white blooms are accented by rich purple-blue flames and sit prettily atop tall, dark stems. Planted in a sunny spot, it offers up loads of flowers for you to enjoy. This is an easy-to-grow, carefree variety that makes an ideal addition to containers, borders and cutting gardens, too.",
